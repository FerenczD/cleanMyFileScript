# cleanMyFileScript
Script made to clean repetitive comments and repetitive, not useful lines, of code!

Really simple to use:
	1. Manually glance your code to determine the repetitive useless lines of code
	2. Set the script in the directory where your file is located - This will make easier to wirte the path for the file name
	3. Input the file name
	4. Enumerate the amount of different comments you want to delete
	5. Type the comment
	6. Copy files from the "Gnerated files" folder to your original directory in order to apply changes
	7. Repeat with other files and save yourself time :)
